This project is based on the work done by paladis, the original
repository can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/gnome-shell-extensions-coverflowalttab/

=== Installation ===

Install from
"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/97/coverflow-alt-tab/",
or just put this directory under
"~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/CoverflowAltTab@palatis.blogspot.com"

=== Usage ===

there are several "Switch xxx" under "Settings => Keyboard => Shortcuts =>
Navigation", this extensions replace a few of them:
  - "Switch applications": cycle through windows from all workspaces
  - "Switch windows of an application": cycle through windows from current
    workspace
  - "Switch system controls": cycle through windows from the same application
    across all workspaces (who wants to cycle through system controls anyway?)
all of the shortcuts with "Shift" key pressed cycles backward.

Hit "Esc" during cycling to cancel.
Hit "q"  during cycling to close highlighted window.
